The purpose of this program is to intake a file with a list of all courses. It will then sort and print the computer science courses. It will also display any prerequisites for any course if there is one.
I approached this project by first creating pseudocode and a flowchart to help visualize all the pieces I needed.
This project really helped me out with the use of pointers and references.
